# Google Homepage (Redesign)

[Google Homepage Redesign (Preview)](https://elnobun.github.io/google-search-page/)

This is a mini-project to rebuild google.com homepage using HTML and
CSS. The goal of this mini-project is to self-reflect on how 
elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get
styled and aligned.
